  
Task 2: 

1. Feasibility – yes, it is possible even it is not a difficult task check the methodology .


2. Methodology – 1. first we capture the frame from the video to get image or screenshot as different frame . 


		             2. then we apply image captioning or object detection then tagging  in image to classify them in some tags. 
        

		             3. now taking the maximum frequency tag from the above tags 

3. Challenges- sometimes captured frame does not contain the need information , image captioning  Is not that much accurate  .
